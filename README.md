Implemented a dynamic stock price prediction system utilizing various machine learning algorithms to forecast stock prices in real-time.
Employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree algorithms to analyze historical stock data and predict future price movements. 
First run these models one by one then save it.
Then run Hybrid.py file. It is a combination of all three algorithms which gives us best accuracy.
